## OO Patterns

There are many design patterns that have been defined and used in building software. For object-oriented design patterns, they can be described in [three major categories](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns):

* Creational Patterns
* Structural patterns
* Behavioral patterns

Define and describe 2 design patterns from each category.


## Free Style

Design patterns have been critized for being too specific and artifically limited by OO language constraints. Find and describe any pattern that may be useful in building software.
